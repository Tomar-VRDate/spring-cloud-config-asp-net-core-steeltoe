Centralized configuration for .NET Core applications using Spring Cloud Config Server and Steeltoe. This approach allows you to manage your application's configuration settings externally, which is particularly beneficial in a microservices architecture. Here are some key points:

- **Spring Cloud Config Server** provides a central place for managing external properties for applications across all environments¹.
- It supports various external configuration sources like the local file system, Git, or HashiCorp Vault¹.
- The configuration is externalized and separated from the code, allowing the same codebase to be deployed across different environments without changes¹.
- **Steeltoe** offers integration with the Spring Cloud Config Server for C# applications, making it easier to retrieve and manage app configuration settings¹.

If you're looking to set up a centralized configuration server or integrate it with your .NET Core application, the resources from the search results can guide you through the process¹²⁴. They provide detailed instructions and examples on how to build and consume remote configuration settings using Spring Cloud Config Server and Steeltoe.
